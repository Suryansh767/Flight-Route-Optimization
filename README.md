# Flight-Route-Optimization-System

The Flight Route Optimization System is a C++ program that finds the shortest flight path between two cities using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm.
It models an air travel network where:

Cities = Nodes (airports)

Flights = Edges (routes with weights such as distance/cost)

The system allows users to select a source city and a destination city, then calculates the shortest distance and prints the optimized travel route.
